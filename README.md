# Ledger Parse

Turn messy vendor invoices into structured data you can review and trust.

Upload a PDF (or try a sample). We pull the text, Gemini fills a fixed schema, a validator flags mismatches, and you confirm or edit. Your edit is the source of truth.

Architecture: [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

Data model: [ERD.md](./ERD.md)

## Screenshots

### Inbox - samples, upload, and Recent

### Review

PDF on the left, fields on the right. Use **Looks correct** on a flagged field, or edit it, then **Save changes**.

## Local setup

You need Node 20+, Docker, and a free [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# put GEMINI_API_KEY in .env
npm install
npm run generate:samples
npm run dev:all
```

App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
API: [http://localhost:3001/health](http://localhost:3001/health)

## Database: why three tables

Extraction is async and can fail or be retried. One PDF row is not enough - we need the file, the work attempt, and the structured result as separate things.

| Table | What it is | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`documents`** | The uploaded or sample PDF (filename, path on disk, `upload` vs `sample`) | The file should outlive a failed extract. Retrying must not require uploading again. |
| **`jobs`** | One extract attempt (`queued` → `extracting` → `ready` / `needs_review` / `failed`) | Gemini can time out or return 503. Status, error codes, and retries live here - not mixed into the invoice. |
| **`invoices`** | The structured fields + validator issues after a successful extract | The reviewable record AP cares about. Only created when extract finishes; user edits update this row. |

Flow in one line: **document** (file) → **job** (work) → **invoice** (result). A failed job has no invoice; Retry creates a new attempt on the same document. Diagram: [ERD.md](./ERD.md).

## What to try

1. **Clean** - should land Ready
2. **Totals mismatch** - **Looks correct** on the total, or change it to `1284.60`, then save
3. **Missing invoice #** / **Bad date** - accept or fix only that field; Inbox stays Needs review until every flagged field is handled
4. **Euro vendor** - different vendor and EUR
5. Upload a non-PDF or a huge file - human error, no stack trace
