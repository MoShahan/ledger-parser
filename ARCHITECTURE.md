# Ledger Parse - architecture design

## 1. Purpose

Ledger Parse turns messy vendor invoice PDFs into structured, reviewable data.

The hard problem is not “call an LLM.” Extraction is often wrong. The product therefore:

1. Extracts with Gemini into a **fixed field schema**
2. Runs a **deterministic validator** (totals, date, currency, invoice #)
3. Shows confidence and issues on a **Review** screen
4. Treats the **user’s edit as source of truth**

Not in scope: auth, chat/RAG, OCR-as-main-path, search filters, multi-tenant, or a regex/template field parser.

## 2. System context

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User["AP / ops user"]
  Browser["Browser SPA"]
  App["Express app\nAPI + static UI"]
  PG[(Postgres)]
  Disk["Upload volume"]
  Gemini["Google Gemini API"]

  User --> Browser
  Browser -->|"HTTP /api, static assets"| App
  App --> PG
  App --> Disk
  App -->|"PDF text + JSON schema"| Gemini
```

One process serves both UI and API in production. Gemini never sees the PDF bytes - only extracted text (capped).

---

## 3. Repository shape

npm workspaces monorepo:

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | Vite + React + TypeScript SPA |
| `backend/` | Express (JS) API, job processor, static host |
| `sample-docs/` | Built-in demo PDFs |
| `.github/workflows/` | FE/BE lint and test Actions |
| `decisions.md` | Running product/stack decisions |
| `ERD.md` | Data model diagram |

---

## 4. Runtime architecture

### Local development

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Vite["Vite :5173\nproxies /api"]
  Express["Express :3001"]
  PGLocal[(Docker Postgres)]
  Uploads["./uploads"]

  Vite --> Express
  Express --> PGLocal
  Express --> Uploads
  Express --> Gemini["Gemini"]
```

- `npm run dev:all` starts Compose Postgres, then Vite + Express.
- Vite proxies `/api` and `/health` to the API so the browser stays same-origin.

### Production (Railway)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Client["Browser"]
  Service["Single Railway service\nnpm start → Express"]
  PGRail[(Railway Postgres)]
  Vol["Volume /data/uploads"]

  Client -->|"one public URL"| Service
  Service --> PGRail
  Service --> Vol
  Service --> Gemini["Gemini"]
```

- Build: Nixpacks `npm ci --include=dev` then `npm run build` (Vite → `frontend/dist`)
- Start: `npm start` (Express serves `frontend/dist` + `/api` + `/health`)
- Config: `railway.json` (Nixpacks, healthcheck `/health`)

---

## 5. Request / extract pipeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as React Inbox
  participant API as Express
  participant FS as Upload store
  participant DB as Postgres
  participant Job as processJob
  participant PDF as unpdf
  participant AI as Gemini
  participant Val as validate

  UI->>API: POST /api/documents or /samples/:key
  API->>FS: store PDF
  API->>DB: insert document + job queued
  API-->>UI: job id
  API->>Job: enqueue setImmediate
  UI->>API: poll GET /api/jobs/:id

  Job->>DB: status extracting
  Job->>FS: read PDF
  Job->>PDF: extract text
  Job->>AI: generateContent JSON fields
  Job->>Val: validate fields
  alt success
    Job->>DB: insert invoice, job ready or needs_review
    UI->>API: GET /api/invoices/:id
  else failure
    Job->>DB: job failed + error_code
    UI->>UI: Retry → POST /api/jobs/:id/retry
  end
```

### Job states

`queued` → `extracting` → `needs_review` | `ready` | `failed`

Retries clear any prior invoice for that job and re-queue extraction.

### Extract details

1. **unpdf** - text only from digital PDFs (not OCR)
2. **Gemini** - fixed JSON shape (vendor, invoice #, date, currency, money fields, line items + confidence/snippets)
3. **Retries** - transient 503/429 with backoff; optional model fallback list
4. **Clip** - PDF text truncated (~8k chars) before the prompt
5. **Validator** - missing invoice #, bad date/currency, line-item sum vs total (`TOTAL_MISMATCH`)

User PATCH on `/api/invoices/:id` applies edits, re-validates, and marks fields `sourceOfTruth: user`.

## 6. API surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness + DB ping |
| `POST` | `/api/documents` | Upload PDF (multipart) |
| `POST` | `/api/documents/samples/:key` | Start sample (`clean`, `mismatch`, `missing`, `euro`, `baddate`) |
| `GET` | `/api/documents/:id/file` | Serve stored PDF for Review iframe |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Poll job (+ `invoiceId` when done) |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/:id/retry` | Re-run failed extraction |
| `GET` | `/api/invoices/:id` | Load invoice + `previewUrl` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/invoices/:id` | Save user field edits |
| `GET` | `/api/inbox?limit&offset` | Paginated recent invoices + failed jobs |

Jobs are processed **in-process** (`setImmediate`). No Redis/queue worker. Fine for a single-instance demo; not multi-replica safe.

---

## 7. Data model

Three tables. See [ERD.md](./ERD.md) for the diagram.

| Table | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `documents` | File metadata + `storage_path`, `source` (`upload` \| `sample`) |
| `jobs` | Extract attempt lifecycle and failure codes |
| `invoices` | Validated `fields` + `issues` JSONB, status `needs_review` \| `ready` |

Cascade deletes: removing a document removes its jobs and invoices.

---

## 8. Frontend architecture

| Route | Screen | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Inbox | Samples, upload, infinite-scroll Recent list |
| `/jobs/:jobId` | JobWait | Progress bar while polling; Retry on failure |
| `/invoices/:id` | Review | PDF preview + editable fields + Confirm & save |

Patterns:

- React Router SPA
- Shared `api.ts` fetch helpers
- Toasts for success/error
- Field/status chips for trust and review state
- TypeScript types mirror invoice/job shapes

---

## 9. Cross-cutting concerns

### Configuration

| Variable | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres (required) |
| `PORT` | Listen port (Railway injects) |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | PDF storage (`./uploads` local, `/data/uploads` on Railway) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Server-only |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Default `gemini-3.8-flash` |
| `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS` / `GEMINI_RETRIES` / `GEMINI_MAX_CHARS` | Extract tuning |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | Upload size cap (default 10) |

### Failure modes

| Case | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Non-PDF / oversize | `400` with human message |
| Unreadable / empty PDF text | Job `failed` (`UNREADABLE` / `EMPTY_TEXT`) |
| Gemini 503 / 429 | Retry, then `MODEL_OVERLOADED` / `RATE_LIMIT` + Retry UI |
| Bad JSON / timeout / missing key | Mapped error codes, user can retry |
| Totals mismatch | Invoice `needs_review` + banner; user fixes total |

### Security (demo posture)

- No auth - anyone with the URL can upload
- API key never sent to the browser
- Digital PDFs only; no OCR pipeline
- Single shared workspace

### Quality gates

- Husky + lint-staged: ESLint on staged JS/TS
- CI: Frontend lint (ESLint, Prettier, typecheck), Frontend Vitest, Backend lint, Backend tests (`node --test`)

## 10. Design tradeoffs (summary)

Documented in detail in [decisions.md](./decisions.md). Headline choices:

- **Gemini over OpenAI** - free-tier API usable for a demo
- **One Railway service** - one URL, no split frontend/API deploy
- **AI + validator + human review** - not a layout-specific parser
- **TS frontend / JS backend** - type the product surface; ship Express faster
- **In-process jobs** - simplest for one instance; swap later if needed
